# MSFS Livery Tools

MSFS Livery Tools aims to be a set of tools to help creating livery for existing aircrafts
on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It is currently capable of:

* Convert texture images from and to DDS format.
* Create the directory structure of a package.
* Create an "aircraft.cfg" file based on the original aircraft and variation information.

## Requirements

MSFS Livery Tools uses [Python 3](https://python.org/) (3.11 is used on development) and
[Microsoft's texconv.exe](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv).
