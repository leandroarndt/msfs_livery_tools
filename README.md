# MSFS Livery Tools

MSFS Livery Tools is a windows application to help creating livery for existing aircrafts
on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It deals with all bureaucratic steps of livery creation,
so that you can focus on your creative work:

* Extract images from glTF JSON files and compress them again to DDS format.
* Package your livery.
* Creating the directory structure of a package.
* Creating an "aircraft.cfg" file based on the original aircraft and variation information.
* Creating a "manifest.json" file (optionally based on the original manifest).
* Creating a "panel.cfg" file and changing:
  * variation override;
  * external registration font color and stroke.
* Creating descriptive JSON files for DDS textures (.DDS.json).
* Creating flag file for textures (.FLAGS) â€“ not on the graphical user interface.
* Creating and updating package layout files ("layout.json").
* Managing thumbnails (converting from capture tool, resizing and adding a placeholder).

## Instalation and usage

Download and install latest [release](https://github.com/leandroarndt/msfs_livery_tools/releases). A shortcut will be created in your windows menu. Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/leandroarndt/msfs_livery_tools/wiki) for help.

You may also download source code and use a Python interpreter.

## Requirements

MSFS Livery Tools uses [Microsoft's texconv.exe](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv)
in order to extract and compress texture files.

## Todo

* Fine texture flags and descriptors control on graphical user interface.
* glTF converter to remove MSFT extension, so that already built aircrafts can be
opened with [Asobo's Blender plugin](https://github.com/AsoboStudio/glTF-Blender-IO-MSFS) (although modifying the original plugin seems more promising).
